## Thoughts/reflections
Working on this was one of my most miserable experiences ever. With little to no knowledge on what a backend does I tried FASTAPI cause of python and I heard that was good for AI. Setting up the lang graph was super interested but I couldn't figure out how to retain user id for memeory of previous chat in the case feedback was wanted for the idea. I went on a LOONNNGG side journey looking into redis to spend 3 days trying to figure how to use docker and implement redis only for it to not work (ended up dropping the feeback feature 🫠). Super fedup but want to continue learning about backend and springboot. Fun experience working on my "full project".
